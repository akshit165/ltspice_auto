Calculation of LTSpice circuit provided is given in the Circuit Analysis.jpeg.
Vx is calculated initially, then Vout is calculated using nodal analysis of the circuit. 

Vo = (Rf/R1) * ((R5*(R4*V3 + R3*V4)*(R1 + R2))/(R4*R5*R1 + R3*R5*R1 + R3*R4*R1 + R4*R5*R2 + R3*R5*R2 + R3*R4*R2) - V1*R2 - V2*R1)/(R2)

After the calculation, the equation for Vo with Vx substituted resembles that of an inverting amplifier circuit with a voltage divider network in the feedback path. The resistors R4 and R5 form a voltage divider network that determines the gain of the circuit. The resistors R1 and R2 form a voltage divider network that sets the input voltage to the amplifier, and the feedback resistor Rf determines the amount of output voltage that is fed back to the input. However, the presence of V3 and V4 in the equation suggests that this circuit may be a more complex configuration than a simple inverting amplifier with a voltage divider network in the feedback path.
